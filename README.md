# Best-Places-to-Live---Time-Inc
Worked on Money Magazine’s “Best Places to Live” interactive map and table. Designed an interactive map and table, ReactJS components, integrating with the Leaflet JavaScript mapping library. Successfully separated data from code by employing asynchronous API calls to populate clickable marketers on the map. Matched design team requirements through the installation of Google fonts, Foundation 6, and responsive SVGs coded responsively via media queries to alter the layout for each screen size.
